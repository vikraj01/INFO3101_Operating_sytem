# Rameshâ€™s basic salary (BASIC) is input through keyboard. His dearness allowance (DA) is 52% of
# BASIC. House rent allowance (HRA) is 15% BASIC. Contributory provident fund is 12% of (BASIC
# + DA). Write a shell script to calculate his gross salary and take home salary using the following
# formula:
# Gross salary = BASIC + DA + HRA + (BASIC + DA) * 0.12
# Take home salary = BASIC + DA + HRA - (BASIC + DA) * 0.12
